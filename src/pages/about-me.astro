        Hi there! I'm Nicolás Zicarelli, a Multimedia Designer born in <a href="https://g.co/kgs/jVqxUFg" target="_blank">Salto</a>, Argentina. Since my childhood, I've developed a deep interest in design, media, and technology.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I've launched this blog to share the notes and thoughts I take for my day-to-day work and personal projects. Things that I usually keep for personal record but could also be useful for someone else. Here you'll find articles about design (UI/UX, branding), front-end development, and some tales about hardware and Internet-related stuff.
      </p>

        I <a href="/posts/a-self-hosted-blog-born-in-quarantine">host this blog</a> from home, which means there might be occasional downtimes during power outages. Additionally, the blog uses <a href="/posts/transitioning-from-cloud-hosting-to-self-hosting/">Cloudflare infrastructure</a> to enhance reliability and performance.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'm based in the city of <a href="https://g.co/kgs/Q3yqCRU" target="_blank">Buenos Aires</a> and work as a Product Designer at Ipsos Argentina.
      </p>
